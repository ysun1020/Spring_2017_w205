In order to come up with the best hospitals given the datasets, I decided to
take measuring metrics from the tables hospitals, effective care, and
readmission. Since these all had different scales, I decided that it was best
to rank the hospitals by different measurements using the scores provided, and
then compare them that way. To do so, I first had to determine how are the
scores measured, and which direction indicates the best score vs the worst
score.

I first did this in the effective cares table, and first looked at which
measure is a measure of care in the hospital, and had enough hospitals
responding to obtain a meaningful ranking. I ended up picking 17 measurements
to examine. First, I categorized them into 3 categories based on types of
measurement. Then I used DENSE_RANK function in Sparksql to rank hospitals by
score for each of the 17 measurements, 1 being the best. I also made certain
to only use valid scores, excluding "Not Available" and scores where
the sample size was less than 25. 

Once I came up with the ranking for all the 17 categories, I started to
examine the readmissions table, which was a bit less straight forward in terms
of scoring than the effective cares table. I ended up using the Compared to
National column and scored hospitals that way, again only counting valid
scores. Similarly, I came up with a ranking for all the hospitals across all
different measures in the readmissions table. 

I then joined these ranking tables together with the hospitals table,
pulling a complete set of provider id, hospital name, state and overall
rating. Since nulls were being treated like 0s, which benefits with the
overall ranking score (adding across all rankings, lowest score being the
best), I create a valid flag for both effective care metrics and readmission
metrics to make sure the data for a hospital is complete enough to be
considered in this comparison. I also put a filter on overall rating in the
hospitals table to only consider the hospitals with overall rating to be 4 or
5. 

I think overall, this is a holistic approach to solve the problem, looking at
rankings allows for a standardized way to compare metrics with different
units. Pulling metrics from hospitals, readmission and effective care tables
also looks at the hospital from multiple perspectives instead of using just
one of those tables.
