I examined the variability of procedures between hospitals using the effective
cares table. I used the same 17 metrics used to examine best hospitals, and
split them by metrics - ones measured in time, and ones measured in
percentage. I calculated the standard deviation for each set of measurement
metrics, and range for only the time unit metrics since percentage range might
be less meaningful given the max range at 100. I ordered the tables from the
largest standard deviation to the smallest to come up with the top procedures
with the greatest variability. 

Since the ratio of number of metrics measured in percent vs time is about 2:1,
I wanted to represent the results using that ratio as well. Thus, I picked 3
procedures with the greatest variability in standard deviation and rage from
the time metrics table and 7 procedures with the greatest variability in
standard deviation from the percent metrics table. 

The results did not come surprising, the top procedures with the greatest
variability are not life-threatening procedures that would result in sudden
death of the patient. Waiting time in the emergency room both to be seen and
to be admitted would be expected to have big variability because doctors and
hospital staff must prioritize patients in order of severity.
